Data is at the heart of [Avira](http://www.avira.com). In many places throughout
Avira the task of extracting insights from massive amounts of data is key. We want
to follow the tradition of other data-driven companies like Google with their
[Unofficial Google Data Science Blog](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com/) 
and Facebook with their [Research at Facebook](https://research.facebook.com/blog/) 
blog, and share our data stories and experiences from within Avira with interested
data scientists around the world.

This blog will include posts on machine learning, statistics, predictive
modeling, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, data visualization, 
big data technology, and other [data science techniques and methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) in the context of Avira
relevant problem domains, including

- virus and malware detection,
- customer insights,
- natural language processing, and
- business intelligence.

Welcome to the **Data Science @ Avira** blog and stay tuned for our first post!
